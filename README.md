# Introduction
This is a code repository for the best practices of react. 

I have created an interesting react project from scratch - A React Advice App. i used React on the front end and we'll make get requests to Advice Slip JSON API.

By completing this project, i got understanding of basic React workflow as well as how to make get requests in React Apps.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
